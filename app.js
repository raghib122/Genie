   "love":  `Like a rose, you bloom and grow,
   Your beauty, a wonder to behold,
   My heart, forever yours to keep,
   As we journey through life, step by step.` ,

   "love": `Your love is a symphony,
   A song that fills my heart;
   Together, we are meant to be. `,

   "poetry":`Like a rose, you bloom and grow,
   Your beauty a sight to behold,
   I am honored to be by your side,
   Forever your love to hold. `,

   "1": `Your love is my home,
   A safe haven to call my own. `,

   "2" :`I don't think you will
   Ever fully understand
   How you've touched my life
   And made me who I am.
   
   I don't think you could ever know
   Just how truly special you are,
   That even on the darkest nights
   You are my brightest star.
   
   You've allowed me to experience
   Something very hard to find,
   Unconditional love that exists
   In my body, soul, and mind.
   
   I don't think you could ever feel
   All the love I have to give,
   And I'm sure you'll never realize
   You've been my will to live.
   
   You are an amazing person,
   And without you I don't know where I'd be.
   Having you in my life
   Completes and fulfills every part of me.`,

   "3":`If you’re feeling down, turn your frown upside down.
   Put a smile on your face; take the world in your embrace.
   Ask for a little help from the man up above.
   And remember you have your best friend’s love.`,

   "4":`The beauty of friendship lies in the heart
   You have a special place from the start
   You care and I can see in your eyes
   All the things I have learned so wise
   I have learnt from you my friend
   There is nothing that I can pretend
   Except for the reason that I love you
   And I simply know its true!
   My friend I love you!`,

   "4": `In Noureen's effortlessness, a brilliant light,
   Charming, kind, and insightful, a good nature's flight.
   I'm close by, through various challenges,
   In your viewpoints, my dear, you've forever been.
   
   A princess uncommon, inside and out,
   In your presence, more splendid sparkles the day.`,

   "5": `In Noureen's presence, beauty takes off,
   Charming, kind, and savvy, a directing light.
   Her heart, a fortune, unadulterated and true,
   In each idea, I'm there for you.
   
   With mind that takes off and astuteness' might,
   She fills our reality with a brilliant light.
   Noureen, a princess, all around,
   In your brilliant air, we track down our day.`,

   "6":`Dosti Hoti Nahi Bhul Jane Ke Liye,Dost Milte Nahi Bikhar Jane Ke Liye,Dosti Karke Khush Rahoge Itna,Ki Waqt Milega Nai Aansu Bahane Ke Liye. .`,

   "7":`Out of your love the fire of youth will rise.
   In the chest, visions of the soul will rise.
   If you are going to kill me, kill me, it is alright.
   When the friend kills, a new life will rise.`,

   "8":`This is love: to fly toward a secret sky,
   to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment.
   First, to let go of live.
   In the end, to take a step without feet;
   to regard this world as invisible,
   and to disregard what appears to be the self.
   
   Heart, I said, what a gift it has been
   to enter this circle of lovers,
   to see beyond seeing itself,
   to reach and feel within the chest.`,

   "9": `A certain person came to the Friend's door
   and knocked.
   "Who's there?"
   "It's me."
   The Friend answered, "Go away. There's no place
   for raw meat at this table."
   
   
   The individual went wandering for a year.
   Nothing but the fire of separation
   can change hypocrisy and ego. The person returned
   completely cooked,
   walked up and down in front of the Friend's house,
   gently knocked.
   "Who is it?"
   "You."
   "Please come in, my self,
   there's no place in this house for two.
   The doubled end of the thread is not what goes through
   the eye of the needle.
   It's a single-pointed, fined-down, thread end,
   not a big ego-beast with baggage."`,

   "10": `What hidden sweetness there is in this emptiness of the belly!
   Man is surely like a lute, no more and no less;
   For if, for instance, the belly of the lute becomes full, no
   lament high or low will arise from that full lute.
   If your brain and belly are on fire through fasting, because of
   the fire every moment a lament will arise from your breast.
   Every moment you will burn a thousand veils by that fire; you
   will mount a hundred steps with zeal and endeavor.
   Become empty of belly, and weep entreatingly like the reed
   pipe; become empty of belly, and tell secrets with the reed pen.
   If your belly is full at the time of concourse, it will bring Satan
   in place of your reason, an idol in place of the Kaaba.
   When you keep the fast, good habits gather together before
   you like slaves and servants and retinue.
   Keep the fast, for that is Solomon’s ring; give not the ring to
   the div, destroy not your kingdom.
   Even if your kingdom has gone from your head and your army
   has fled, your army will rise up, pennants flying above them.
   The table arrived from heaven to the tents of the fast, by the
   intervention of the prayers of Jesus, son of Mary.
   In the fast, be expectant of the table of bounty, for the table of
   bounty is better than the broth of cabbages.`,

   "11": `You personify God's message.
   You reflect the Queen's face.
   There is nothing in the universe that you are not
   Everything you want, look for it within yourself--
   you are that.`,

   "12": `“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing
   and rightdoing there is a field.
   I’ll meet you there.
   When the soul lies down in that grass
   the world is too full to talk about.”`,

   "13":`“The minute I heard my first love story,
   I started looking for you, not knowing
   how blind that was.
   Lovers don’t finally meet somewhere.
   They’re in each other all along.”`,

   "14": `“I want to see you.
   Know your voice. Recognize you when you
   first come ’round the corner. Sense your scent when I come
   into a room you’ve just left. Know the lift of your heel,
   the glide of your foot. Become familiar with the way
   you purse your lips
   then let them part,
   just the slightest bit,
   when I lean in to your space
   and kiss you. I want to know the joy
   of how you whisper
   “more”`,

   "14":`“I said to the night,
   “If you are in love with the moon,
   it is because you never stay for long.”
   The night turned to me and said,
   “It is not my fault. I never see the Sun,
   how can I know that love is endless?”`,

   "15": `“If I love myself
   I love you.
   If I love you
   I love myself.”`,

   "16": `“Lovers find secret places
   inside this violent world
   where they make transactions
   with beauty.”`,

   "17": `“If you are seeking, seek us with joy
   For we live in the kingdom of joy.
   Do not give your heart to anything else
   But to the love of those who are clear joy,
   Do not stray into the neighborhood of despair.
   For there are hopes: they are real, they exist –
   Do not go in the direction of darkness –
   I tell you: suns exist.”`,

   "18": `“Love isn’t the work of the tender and the gentle;
   Love is the work of wrestlers.
   The one who becomes a servant of lovers
   is really a fortunate sovereign.
   Don’t ask anyone about Love; ask Love about Love.
   Love is a cloud that scatters pearls.”`,

   "a":`“This is how I would die
   into the love I have for you:
   As pieces of cloud
   dissolve in sunlight.”`,

   "A": `“Love so needs to love
   that it will endure almost anything, even abuse,
   just to flicker for a moment. But the sky’s mouth is kind,
   its song will never hurt you, for I
   sing those words.”`,

   "b": `    How long wilt thou dwell on words and superficialities?

   A burning heart is what I want; consort with burning.

   Kindle in thy heart the flame of Love,

   And burn up utterly thoughts and fine expressions.`,

   "c":`Love’s way is humility and intoxication,
   The torrent floods down. How can it run up?
   You’ll be a cabuchon in the ring of lovers,
   If you’re a red ruby’s slave, dear friend ;
   Even as Earth is a serf of the sapphire sky
   And your monkey body’s a slave to your spirit.
   
   What did Earth ever lose by this relationship ?
   What mercy has the Self showed to weary limbs ?
   One shouldn’t beat the snare drum of awakening
   Beneath a cosy sofa’s, comfy counterpane.
   
   Hoist, like a hero, your flag in the desert.
   Listen with your soul’s ear to the song,
   In that hollow of the vast turquoise dome,
   Rising from the lover’s passionate moan .
   
   When your tight gown-strings are loosened
   By the tipsy inebriation of perfect love,
   The victorious heavens shout, triumphantly !
   And the constellations gaze down ashamed.
   This world is in deep trouble, from top to bottom,
   But it can be swiftly healed by the balm of love .`,

   






    "Rumi": `If anyone asks you
    how the perfect satisfaction
    of all our sexual wanting
    will look, lift your face
    and say,
    
    Like this.
    
    When someone mentions the gracefulness
    of the nightsky, climb up on the roof
    and dance and say,
    
    Like this.
    
    If anyone wants to know what “spirit” is,
    or what “God’s fragrance” means,
    lean your head toward him or her.
    Keep your face there close.
    
    Like this.
    
    When someone quotes the old poetic image
    about clouds gradually uncovering the moon,
    slowly loosen knot by knot the strings
    of your robe.
    
    Like this.
    
    If anyone wonders how Jesus raised the dead,
    don’t try to explain the miracle.
    Kiss me on the lips.
    
    Like this. Like this.
    
    When someone asks what it means
    to “die for love,” point
    here.
    
    If someone asks how tall I am, frown
    and measure with your fingers the space
    between the creases on your forehead.
    
    This tall.
    
    The soul sometimes leaves the body, the returns.
    When someone doesn’t believe that,
    walk back into my house.
    
    Like this.
    
    When lovers moan,
    they’re telling our story.
    
    Like this.
    
    I am a sky where spirits live.
    Stare into this deepening blue,
    while the breeze says a secret.
    
    Like this.
    
    When someone asks what there is to do,
    light the candle in his hand.
    
    Like this.
    
    How did Joseph’s scent come to Jacob?
    
    Huuuuu.
    
    How did Jacob’s sight return?
    
    Huuuu.
    
    A little wind cleans the eyes.
    
    Like this.
    
    When Shams comes back from Tabriz,
    he’ll put just his head around the edge
    of the door to surprise us
    
    Like this.`,
